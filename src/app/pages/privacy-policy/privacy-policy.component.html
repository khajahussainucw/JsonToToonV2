      <p>Welcome to jsonparser.ai. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we keep it safe when you use our website.</p>

      <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
      <p>Our tool helps you parse and visualize JSON data in different formats. You don't need to sign up or create an account. The JSON you paste into our tool is processed in real-time and never stored on our servers.</p>
      <p><strong>We do not save any JSON data at our servers.</strong></p>

      <h2>2. Use of Collected Information</h2>
      <p>When you paste JSON data into our tool, we use it only to parse and display it for you. Once you close the page or clear the data, it's gone. We don't save, store, or reuse your JSON for anything else.</p>
      <p>If you reach out to us through the contact form, we'll collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email Address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We only use this info to reply to your message. We won't share it with anyone else unless you give us permission.</p>

      <h2>3. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity to analyze website traffic and improve your experience on our site. These tools help us understand user behavior, manage site performance, and identify any issues with site functionality.</p>
