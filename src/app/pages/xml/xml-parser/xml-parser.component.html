      <h2 class="content-heading">What is XML Parser?</h2>
      <p class="content-text">
        Ever looked at a wall of XML and wished you could just see it as a table? That's what this tool does. XML Parser takes your <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a> and turns it into interactive HTML tables you can actually work with.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        Whether you're debugging an API response, analyzing data exports, or trying to make sense of a config file, this tool saves you time. No more manually parsing through nested elements or writing scripts just to view your data. According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a>, XML is widely used for data storage and configuration, and our parser handles all standard XML structures.
      </p>
      <p class="content-text">
        The best part? Everything runs in your browser. Your data never touches our servers unless you explicitly share it. It's fast, free, and private.

            <p class="step-description">As soon as you paste, the table appears on the right. Elements turn into rows, attributes become columns. Got nested data? It shows up as tables within tables. The parsing follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C XML specification</a>, so it handles everything standard XML supports.</p>

            <p class="use-case-text">Your API returns XML, but you can't tell if the structure is right. Paste it here, see it as a table, and spot missing elements instantly. Works great with SOAP APIs or REST APIs that return XML. Much faster than writing a script just to view data.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Do you store my XML data?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Nope. Everything runs in your browser using JavaScript. Your XML never leaves your computer unless you click "Share" to create a link. Even then, you control when it expires. We follow the same privacy principles as tools like <a href="https://jsonformatter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON Formatter</a> – process locally, keep it private.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What XML formats work?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Anything that's valid XML according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C XML specification</a>. Elements, attributes, nested structures, namespaces, CDATA sections – all of it. Complex nesting just creates more nested tables.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I edit the data?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Yes. Click "Edit" and double-click any cell. Change the value, hit Enter, and it updates automatically. You can also remove columns entirely if you don't need them. It's like editing a spreadsheet, but your XML structure stays intact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How does filtering work?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Type in the boxes at the top of each column. It filters rows that contain your search term in that column. You can filter multiple columns at once – it shows rows that match all your filters. Case-insensitive, so "john" finds "John" too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What can I export to?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Right now, Excel (.xls format). Opens in Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice – basically any spreadsheet app. The table structure stays intact, so nested data becomes nested tables in Excel too. We're looking at adding CSV export soon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3 class="faq-question">How big can my XML file be?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">No hard limit, but performance depends on your browser. Small files (under 1MB) parse instantly. Files around 5MB might take a second or two. Really huge files (10MB+) can slow things down, but they'll still work. If you're dealing with massive datasets, consider using a tool like <a href="https://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XMLStarlet</a> for command-line processing.</p>
